# Sudoku Solver (Java – Console Based)

This is a simple Java-based Sudoku solver that uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to fill an incomplete 9x9 Sudoku grid. The project is console-based and built to reinforce core DSA concepts like recursion, constraint checking, and 2D array traversal.

## Features

- Backtracking Algorithm* – Efficiently solves Sudoku by trying valid numbers recursively.
-  Constraint Validation – Ensures each number follows standard Sudoku rules:
- No duplicates in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
- Console Output – The solution (or failure message) is printed directly to the terminal.
